                    <p>Everyone loves a good stick figure. Or stick-figure like figure. I don’t know what design trend you would call it, but I hold a special penchant towards the simple block graphics of the 2000’s: thick lines, rounded edges and the like. After creating a devil-like figure in this style in Photoshop and Illustrator for a personal project, I thought a good idea for my portfolio’s logo would be to draw myself the same style.</p>

                    <p>As opposed to using WordPress for my website’s implementation, I decided to take a stab at coding my portfolio by hand. As an aspiring web developer, my initial goal was ambitious: create my website as a fully flexible design, using industry-standard advanced frameworks. But after much deliberation and YouTube tutorial-watching, I decided my best path would be to code websites like I had been: in stone-cold HTML and CSS – though this supposed hurdle allowed for my logo to have a fitting home. The rounded corner, vector graphics logo pairs well with the simplistic website design I made.</p>

                    <p>I kept in mind many tenets of web design while constructing my portfolio. For one, I made a concerned effort to keep colors consistent – mainly dark grays, light blues, and dark blues. The background being dark blue while the content is enveloped in a lighter blue was an attempt to emphasize readability. Additionally, I kept modularity in mind when fleshing out my pages. While I did end up making many pages from scratch, I kept a consistent framework such that I could copy and paste the overall structure and merely change the content inside. This undoubtedly sped up what would otherwise be a tenuous and difficult design process.</p>

                    <p>I sought to keep my website easily legible and navigable, and I believe the logo reflects such ideals. With using Helvetica as my font and thick lines in my design, I subliminally communicate my enthusiasm in cartoons, satire, and graphic design to the viewer. At the same time, a sense of comfort and relatability is provided through my cartoon’s design.</p>

                    <p>The influence Adobe Illustrator had on my logo’s design was immense – using vector shapes and triangles allowed me to create a person that looks both handmade and professional. At the same time, however, I ended up going back to my familiar grounds of Photoshop, such as when I added text. I also used Photoshop’s “export to web” option to get a dithered PNG photo – you can see it here in my logo if you zoom into the shadow.</p>

                    <p>I am satisfied with my website. It is small but effective, easy to read, airtight and easy to navigate. This same line of thought extends to the logo. Although I might have changed the logo color to match the darker background at some point, and the entire implementation could scale to a mobile platform better. My website is not mobile-first optimized, and while that is not inherently a detriment, it is undeniably something to address in our modern landscape.</p>

                    <p>After some difficulties nailing a design I liked and messing with various JavaScript frameworks, my website became a lean portfolio. It made me more proud of the work I have done this semester and made me think of ways I can implement my own website design into a professional portfolio. My major, Digital Narrative and Interactive Design, affords itself strongly towards digital media.</p>

                    <p>Every project – poster, podcast, video, website – challenged my creative instincts and forced me to consider the affordances and limitations of digital mediums. In making posters, I learned how to tailor my rhetoric for optimal readability, and my graphic design for aesthetically pleasure. In my podcast, I learned how to effectively interview, mix audio, and use open source databases to enhance my storytelling. In my video, I furthered my knowledge in open-source resources and the creative commons. And through my website I refined my web-design skills and started my much-needed venture into Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                    <p>All in all, every project in Composing Digital Media offered something of value to my real-life portfolio of skills. Being able to look back on this semester through my website puts the entire class into perspective for me: seeing how many programs and websites I learned to use in one place gives me greater motivation for the future: if I was able to make this diverse an array of digital media in three months, one can only imagine what is possible for the future.</p>
